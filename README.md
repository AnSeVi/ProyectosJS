# ProyectosJS
Hi everyone, I am Andrés and this is my first public repository where you can find the projects I did in the Platzi "Practical JavaScript" course.

------------


This repository has four projects at the moment:
### 1. Geometric Figures
In this project, you can calculate the perimeter and area of ​​three figures: square, triangle, and circle.

If you want me to add another figure, please email me at this address: vivancosebastian@gmail.com

### 2. Prices and Discounts
Here you can calculate the discount of the product you like and you have the option of using a discount ticket. On the page of this project you can find a list with many products, their price and a random discount.

### 3. Average, Mode and Median
This repository also has some basic statistical topics. The average is the sum of all the data in a list, divided by the number of elements, the median is the element that is in the central position and the mode is the element that is repeated the most in the list.

### 4. 	Salary Analysis 
In the final project you can analyze your salary with the cost of living in the city where you live or would like to live.
